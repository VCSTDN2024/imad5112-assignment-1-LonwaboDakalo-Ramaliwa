The purpose

## Project Overview

The Meal and Food Establishment App is a mobile app developed as part of an assignment in the [IMAD5112] subject. This application was developed using the programming language **Kotlin** and developer app **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to provide users with a meal suggestion after the correct input is inserted into the app.

The app is developed to meet the requirements of the assignment which entails being a functional app that users can smoothly use and operates correctly with the correct logical and purpose and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

3. App Purpose and Features
---------------------------


## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to provide users with a meal suggestion when the correct input is inserted. 

### Key Features
- Feature 1: Error Handling
- Feature 2: An additional page to app
- Feature 3: Toast texts
- Feature 4: Do not leave empty
- Feature 5: Accepts correct text written in any format

These features aim to provide users with a simple to use and understand app that ensures only when the correct input inserted will the user be able to operate the app and text will be displayed if the user uses the incorrect input 
-----

Reasoning:
----
- Feature 1: Error Handling- App will display a output informing the user that input is incorrect, display an appropriate message and will not display any other output.
- Feature 2: An Additional Page to App- App has a secondary page that ties to the home page. The second page operates with the same inputs but displays food places instead of meal options.
- Feature 3: Toast Texts- The toast texts are here to inform the user on what to do if they are struggling to figure out what input is the correct input to insert into the app for it to work. It acts as a guidance system.
- Feature 4: Do Not Leave Empty: Only changing the pages, clearing all data and exit will work because it is functions that work without the need for the user to insert data into the textbox. The rest of the app needs the textbox to have info before anything can happen. It is here to prevent app failure, such as: Pressing the button for output, but no input was placed.
- Feature 5: Accepts Correct Text Written In Any Format- App will accept the correct input text no matter the format and font style (e.g. DAWN; Dusk; NiGhT; snack).

4. Design Considerations
------------------------


## Design Considerations

The design of the **Meal and Food Establishment App** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience (UX)**:  The app is made to cater to all users, so it must be easily readable without difficulties and not difficult to use.
   
2. **Responsiveness**:  The device is made to be adaptable to all different device sizes and not hinder the experience because of the device not being able to fully operate on the device.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is simple to understand and is not difficult to use. It has prompts to assist users in the event they do not understand how to use the app.
   
4. **Performance**: The app’s goal is to not overexert the capabilities of the device the app is being run on, remain efficient in fast response times and maintain a low battery usage.

5. GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization
----------------------------------------
## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I utilized **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

### Video Demo:
**App showcase:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxKevJYnAKk.

Reasoning:
----
-  Showing visuals allow the user to have a better understanding of the app and be able to see how the app looks and familiarise themselves with the app and reduce the risk of confusion when using the app. It decreases the risk of mistrust in the app because they are shown the app working and it provide an overview on how to use the app correctly.

7. Challenges and Learnings
---------------------------


## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I experienced many problems such as:

1. **Challenge 1**: how to make my app more innovative
   - **Solution**:  Add a second page to the app with a function that adds to the home page.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: How can the app be more appealing
   - **Solution**: Inserting a background colour to the whole app, changing the colour of the buttons and inserting an image to the bottom of both pages of my app

3. **Challenge 3**: My readme got deleted 
   - **Solution**: Creating a backup document on word or notepad so I can easily retrieve my data in the event it gets lost again and avoid the hassle of restarting the whole document.

From these challenges, I learned important lessons in keeping backups in the event of accidents to not lose progress in the work done, having a clear idea when developing an app and allowing your ideas to influence the app’s design. It is important to focus on the main task, so the other factors need to be placed on hold until that is completely taken care of.



8. Future Enhancements
----------------------

```
## Future Enhancements
Features that can be added in the future:

1. **Feature 1**: Adding a third page that can provide users with beverages if interested.
2. **Feature 2**: Adding a scrollbar of options instead of user typed input.
3. **Feature 3**:  Having a picture background instead of a background colour.

```

Reasoning:
----
- **Feature 1**: Adding a third page that can provide users with beverages if interested.
It is to make the app more inclusive considering not many people will eat food at every day time period so suggesting beverages for the time periods will allow the app to be more inclusive and more engaging for all users of the app.

- **Feature 2**: Adding a scrollbar of options instead of user typed input.
It is here to allow the users to relax when using and the app and will work much better because users are able to pick an option then figure out the correct input for the app to work or worry about spelling errors.

- **Feature 3**:  Having a picture background instead of a background colour.
It attracts the user’s attention more easily and is more visually pleasing and engaging compared to an app with a background colour.

These features are here to make an amazing experience for the users of the app and allow the app to be an engaging entertainment than another stress factor because of its complex nature
